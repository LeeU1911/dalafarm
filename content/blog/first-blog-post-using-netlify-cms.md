I've long been a big fan of gohugo static site generator. However, everytime I tried to introduce the workflow of editing and creating a new blog post for a non-tech colleague, it's always a pain in the ass. 

Therefore, I'm so happy that I found Netlify CMS, probably one of the best CMS for static site out there. I could set this up and running in my local under 1 hour and I'm already writing my very first blog post on Netlify CMS admin interface without touch my Webstorm IDE!

No more weird looks from my co-workers ever again!

P/S: I'm gonna insert an image just to illustrate how easy it is to use for media files as well!
